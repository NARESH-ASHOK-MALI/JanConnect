# üéØ STATE-ADMIN ACCESS FIX - BACKEND AUTHORIZATION

## Problem Identified ‚úÖ

**Issue**: State-Admin users were getting **"Not authorized as admin"** error when accessing the Reports page.

**Root Cause**: The `/api/users` endpoint in `server/routes/userRoutes.js` was using `adminOnly` middleware, which only allows `MoSJE-Admin` role. This blocked State-Admin users from fetching user data needed for reports.

---

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ

### File: `server/routes/userRoutes.js`

**Changed Line 15** (Import statement):
```javascript
// BEFORE:
const { protect, adminOnly } = require('../middleware/authMiddleware');

// AFTER:
const { protect, adminOnly, stateAdminOnly } = require('../middleware/authMiddleware');
```

**Changed Line 26** (GET users route):
```javascript
// BEFORE:
router.get('/', protect, adminOnly, getUsers);

// AFTER:
router.get('/', protect, stateAdminOnly, getUsers);  // Now allows State-Admin
```

---

## What This Fix Does ‚úÖ

1. **Allows State-Admin to access `/api/users` endpoint** - Required for generating reports
2. **Maintains security** - Still requires authentication and proper role (State-Admin or MoSJE-Admin)
3. **Doesn't affect other routes** - Only the GET users route was changed

---

## Authorization Middleware Reference

From `server/middleware/authMiddleware.js`:

### `adminOnly` Middleware
```javascript
// Only allows MoSJE-Admin
const adminOnly = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user && req.user.role === 'MoSJE-Admin') {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403);
    throw new Error('Not authorized as admin');
  }
};
```

### `stateAdminOnly` Middleware
```javascript
// Allows both State-Admin and MoSJE-Admin
const stateAdminOnly = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.user && (req.user.role === 'State-Admin' || req.user.role === 'MoSJE-Admin')) {
    next();
  } else {
    res.status(403);
    throw new Error('Not authorized as state admin or higher');
  }
};
```

## Testing After Fix ‚úÖ

### 1. **Restart Backend Server**
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
cd server
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Login as State-Admin**
- Email: `state.mh@example.com`
- Password: (your password)

### 3. **Navigate to Reports Page**
- Click "Reports" in sidebar
- Page should load successfully
- No "Not authorized" error

### 4. **Verify Data Loading**
- Statistics cards should show data
- No errors in browser console
- API calls succeed (check Network tab)

### Project Routes (`/api/projects`)
| Endpoint | Method | Middleware | Allowed Roles |
|----------|--------|------------|---------------|
| `/` | GET | `protect` | All authenticated users |
| `/` | POST | `stateAdminOnly` | State-Admin, MoSJE-Admin |

## Expected Behavior After Fix ‚úÖ

### For State-Admin Users:
1. ‚úÖ Can login successfully
2. ‚úÖ Can access Dashboard
3. ‚úÖ Can view/create/edit Projects in their state
4. ‚úÖ Can manage Agencies in their state
5. ‚úÖ **Can access Reports page** (FIXED)
6. ‚úÖ **Can access Analytics page** (FIXED)
7. ‚úÖ **Can fetch user data** (FIXED)
8. ‚ùå Cannot access All Users management page (route restricted in frontend)
9. ‚ùå Cannot delete users (backend restricted to MoSJE-Admin)
10. ‚ùå Cannot delete projects/agencies (backend restricted to MoSJE-Admin)

### For MoSJE-Admin Users:
- ‚úÖ All State-Admin permissions
- ‚úÖ Plus: Can manage all users
- ‚úÖ Plus: Can delete any project/agency
- ‚úÖ Plus: Can approve/reject user registrations
- ‚úÖ Plus: Can access Settings page
