## 💡 Best Practices

### For Admins
1. **Review before approve**: Check user details carefully
2. **Provide clear rejection reasons**: Help users understand
3. **Use search**: Find users quickly
4. **Filter by status**: Focus on pending approvals
5. **Refresh regularly**: See latest registrations
6. **Don't delete yourself**: System prevents this

### For Developers
1. **Use confirm dialogs**: Prevent accidental actions
2. **Show loading states**: processingId tracks operations
3. **Auto-refresh after actions**: Keep data current
4. **Validate forms**: Check required fields
5. **Handle errors gracefully**: Show user-friendly messages
