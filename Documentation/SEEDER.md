# Database Seeder Documentation

## Overview
The JanConnect project includes a comprehensive database seeder that populates MongoDB with realistic demo data for testing and development purposes.

## What Data is Seeded?

### 1. Agencies (8 total)
**Maharashtra (3 agencies):**
- Social Justice Department Maharashtra (Implementing)
- Municipal Corporation Pune (Executing)
- Zilla Parishad Nagpur (Executing)

**Uttar Pradesh (3 agencies):**

- Greater Chennai Corporation (Executing)

### 2. Users (5 total)
All users have the password: `password123`

| Email | Role | State | Access Level |
|-------|------|-------|--------------|
| admin@example.com | MoSJE-Admin | - | Full system access |
| state.mh@example.com | State-Admin | Maharashtra | Maharashtra projects only |
| state.up@example.com | State-Admin | Uttar Pradesh | UP projects only |
| agency.pune@example.com | Agency-User | Maharashtra | Pune MC projects only |
| agency.lucknow@example.com | Agency-User | Uttar Pradesh | Lucknow NN projects only |

### 3. Projects (10 total)
- Distributed across Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu
- Mix of Adarsh Gram, GIA, and Hostel components
- Various statuses: Sanctioned, In-Progress, Completed, Delayed
- Each project includes:
  - Complete financial details (sanctioned, released, utilized amounts)
  - Multiple milestones with deadlines and completion status
  - Beneficiary information
  - Linked implementing and executing agencies

## How to Use the Seeder

### Prerequisites
1. MongoDB must be running
2. Environment variables must be configured (`.env` file in server directory)
3. Required packages must be installed (`npm install` in server directory)

### Import Demo Data
```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸš€ Starting Database Seeder...
ðŸ“¦ MongoDB Connected...
âœ… Step 1: 8 Agencies inserted
âœ… Step 2: 5 Users inserted
âœ… Step 3: 10 Projects inserted
âœ… Data imported successfully!
```

### Delete All Data (Clean Reset)
```bash
cd server
npm run seed:destroy
```

**Expected Output:**
```
ðŸš€ Starting Database Cleanup...
ðŸ“¦ MongoDB Connected...
âœ… Projects deleted
âœ… Users deleted
âœ… Agencies deleted
âœ… All data destroyed successfully!
```

## Technical Details

### File Structure
```
server/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ demoData.js       # Demo data definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ seeder.js         # Seeder script logic
â””â”€â”€ package.json          # Contains seed scripts
```

### Seeding Process
The seeder follows a specific order to maintain referential integrity:

1. **Agencies First**: Inserts all agencies and stores their ObjectIds
2. **Users Second**: 
   - Hashes passwords using bcrypt
   - Links Agency-Users to their agencies using `agencyName`
   - Stores user ObjectIds for project linking
3. **Projects Last**:
   - Links to implementing and executing agencies
   - Links to created-by users
   - Includes complete milestone and financial data

### Destruction Process
Data is deleted in reverse order to avoid reference errors:
1. Projects (depends on agencies and users)
2. Users (depends on agencies)
3. Agencies (no dependencies)

## Troubleshooting

### "MongoDB connection error"
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check `MONGODB_URI` in `.env` file
- Verify network connectivity

### "Cannot find module"
- Run `npm install` in the server directory
- Ensure you're in the correct directory

### "Duplicate key error"
- Run `npm run seed:destroy` first to clean existing data
- Then run `npm run seed` again

### "Agency not found" during seeding
- This indicates the agency names in users/projects don't match
- Check `demoData.js` for consistency

## Best Practices

1. **Development**: Run seeder whenever you need fresh data
2. **Testing**: Use `seed:destroy` then `seed` for clean test environment
3. **Production**: Never run seeder on production databases
4. **Git**: The `.env` file is gitignored - configure it locally
