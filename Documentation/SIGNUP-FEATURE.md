# Signup Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added user self-registration functionality to JanConnect with support for all three user roles. New users can sign up with their accounts pending admin approval.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Components

#### **SignupPage.jsx** (NEW)
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/SignupPage.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Glassmorphism design matching LoginPage
  - Role selection dropdown (MoSJE-Admin, State-Admin, Agency-User)
  - Conditional fields based on role:
    - **Agency-User**: Must select an agency
    - **State-Admin**: Must select a state from dropdown (28 Indian states)
    - **MoSJE-Admin**: No additional fields required
  - Client-side form validation with error messages
  - Password confirmation field
  - Loading states with spinner animation
  - Info notice about admin approval requirement
  - Link back to LoginPage
  - Fetches agencies dynamically from backend API

#### **LoginPage.jsx** (UPDATED)
- Added "Don't have an account? Sign up here" link
- Link navigates to `/signup` route
- Added `Link` import from react-router-dom

#### **App.js** (UPDATED)
- Added import for `SignupPage` component
- Added public route: `<Route path="/signup" element={<SignupPage />} />`

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### **userController.js** (UPDATED)
- **New Function**: `registerUserPublic`
  - **Route**: POST `/api/users/register-public`
  - **Access**: Public (no authentication required)
  - **Features**:
    - Validates all required fields (name, email, password, role)
    - Checks for existing users with same email
    - Role-specific validation (agency for Agency-User, state for State-Admin)
    - Creates user with `isActive: false` (pending admin approval)
    - Does NOT return JWT token (user must be approved first)
    - Returns success message with user data
  - **Security**: Passwords are hashed automatically by User model

#### **userRoutes.js** (UPDATED)
- Added public route: `router.post('/register-public', registerUserPublic);`
- Existing admin-protected registration endpoint remains unchanged

---

## User Flow

### Signup Process
1. User visits `/signup` page
2. Fills out registration form:
   - Full Name
   - Email Address
   - Role selection (dropdown)
   - Agency (if Agency-User) or State (if State-Admin)
   - Password + Confirmation
3. Form validates all fields client-side
4. On submit, sends POST request to `/api/users/register-public`
5. Backend creates user with `isActive: false`
6. User sees success message: "Registration successful! Please wait for admin approval."
7. User redirected to `/login` page
8. User CANNOT login until admin activates account

### Admin Approval Process
1. Admin logs into system
2. Navigates to Users Management page
3. Sees list of pending users (`isActive: false`)
4. Reviews user details and approves/rejects
5. Updates user's `isActive` status to `true`
6. User can now login successfully

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/users/register-public` | Public user registration (pending approval) |
| POST | `/api/users/login` | User authentication |

### Protected Endpoints (Admin Only)
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/users/register` | Admin creates active user immediately |
| GET | `/api/users` | Get all users with filters |
| PUT | `/api/users/:id` | Update user (including `isActive` status) |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Delete user |

---

## Security Features

1. **Password Hashing**: Passwords hashed with bcrypt (handled by User model)
2. **Email Uniqueness**: Checks for duplicate emails before registration
3. **Role Validation**: Validates role-specific required fields
4. **Admin Approval**: New users are inactive until approved
5. **JWT Protection**: Registration does NOT issue token (must be approved first)
6. **Client Validation**: Form validation prevents invalid submissions

---

## Design Features

### Glassmorphic UI Elements
- Backdrop blur effects (`backdrop-blur-2xl`)
- Semi-transparent backgrounds (`bg-neutral-900/40`)
- Gradient overlays (`from-primary-900/80`)
- Rounded corners (`rounded-3xl`, `rounded-xl`)
- Border highlights (`border-white/10`)
- Hover effects (`hover:scale-[1.02]`, `hover:shadow-hover`)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Scrollable form for small screens (`max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto`)
- Flexible width (`max-w-2xl`)
- Proper spacing and padding

### User Experience
- Loading spinner during submission
- Field-level error messages (red text, red borders)
- Disabled submit button during loading
