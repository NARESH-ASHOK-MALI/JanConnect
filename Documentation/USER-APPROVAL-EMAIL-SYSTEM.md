# üìß User Approval & Email Notification System

## Overview
Implemented a complete admin approval workflow with automatic email notifications for user registrations. When admins approve or reject user accounts, the system sends professional HTML emails to notify users.

---

## ‚ú® Features

### 1. **Admin Approval Workflow**
- Admins can view all pending user registrations
- Approve users with one click
- Reject users with a reason
- Real-time status updates

### 2. **Email Notifications**
- **Approval Email**: Professional HTML email sent when user is approved
- **Rejection Email**: Notification with reason when registration is rejected
- **Development Mode**: Emails logged to console (no SMTP needed for dev)
- **Production Mode**: Real SMTP integration for live emails

### 3. **Security**
- Only MoSJE-Admin role can approve/reject users
- Email sending doesn't block the approval process
- Secure token-based authentication for admin actions

## üéØ How It Works

### User Registration Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Registers] --> B[Account Created - isActive: false]
    B --> C[Admin Notified]
    C --> D{Admin Decision}
    D -->|Approve| E[isActive set to true]
    D -->|Reject| F[Account Deleted]
    E --> G[Approval Email Sent]
    F --> H[Rejection Email Sent]
    G --> I[User Can Login]
    H --> J[User Notified]
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **User Signs Up** (`/signup`)
   - Fills registration form
   - Selects role (MoSJE-Admin, State-Admin, or Agency-User)
   - Provides role-specific info (agency/state)
   - Submits form

2. **Account Created** (Backend)
   - User saved to database with `isActive: false`
   - Cannot login until approved
   - Success message shown

3. **Admin Reviews** (`/pending-users`)
   - Admin logs in and navigates to "Pending Users"
   - Sees list of all pending registrations
   - Reviews user details (name, email, role, agency/state)

4. **Admin Approves**
   - Clicks "‚úÖ Approve" button
   - Backend:
     - Sets `isActive: true`
     - Sends HTML approval email
     - Returns success

5. **User Receives Email**
   - Professional HTML email with:
     - Account approval confirmation
     - Login credentials reminder
     - Direct link to login page
     - Account details summary

6. **User Can Login**
   - User visits login page
   - Enters credentials
   - Successfully logs in

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

Add these to `server/.env`:

```bash
# Email Configuration (Optional - for user approval notifications)
# For development: Leave blank to log emails to console
# For production: Configure SMTP settings

# Gmail Example:
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your_app_password
SMTP_FROM="JanConnect <noreply@janconnect.gov.in>"

# SendGrid Example:
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_USER=apikey
# SMTP_PASS=your_sendgrid_api_key

# Other SMTP services work too!
```

### Development Mode (Default)

When SMTP is not configured, emails are logged to the backend console:

```
üìß ========== EMAIL NOTIFICATION ==========
To: user@example.com
Subject: üéâ Your JanConnect Account Has Been Approved
-------------------------------------------
Dear John Doe,

Great news! Your JanConnect account has been approved...
===========================================
```

### Production Mode

Configure SMTP settings in `.env` to send real emails.

### Issue: Admin can't see Pending Users page

**Solution**:
1. Check user role is `MoSJE-Admin`
2. Verify JWT token is valid
3. Check console for permission errors
4. Ensure route is protected correctly

### Issue: Approval works but no email

**Solution**:
1. Check backend console for email logs (dev mode)
2. Verify SMTP settings (production)
3. Check email service logs
4. Test with simple email client

### Issue: User still can't login after approval
